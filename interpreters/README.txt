apps/interpreters README file
=============================

This apps/ directory is set aside to hold interpreters that may be
incorporated into NuttX.

ficl
----

  This is DIY port of Ficl (the "Forth Inspired Command Language").  See
  http://ficl.sourceforge.net/.  It is a "DIY" port because the Ficl source
  is not in that directory, only an environment and instructions that will
  let you build Ficl under NuttX.  The rest is up to you.
